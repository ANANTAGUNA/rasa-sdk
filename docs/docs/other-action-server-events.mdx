Conversations in Rasa are represented as a sequence of events. Some events are tracked automatically by the Rasa server,
such as a user sending a message,
while others can only be tracked if they are returned by a custom action. 
Custom actions can influence the course of a conversation by returning events as part of their [output](other-action-servers.mdx#events).

## Event Types


### Set a Slot

Sets a slot on the tracker. It can set a slot to a value, 
or reset a slot by setting its value to `null`. 

**Automatic Tracking**:

* Whenever a slot is filled by an entity of the same name. 

A custom action is needed
to set any slot not auto-filled by an entity. 


**JSON**:

```json
{
    "event": "slot",
    "name": "departure_airport", 
    "value": "BER"
}
```


**Parameters**:

* `name`: Name of the slot to set
* `value`: Value to set the slot to. The datatype must match the [type](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/next/domain#slot-types)
   of the slot

**Rasa Open Source Class**: `rasa.core.events.SlotSet`



### Restart a Conversation

Resets the tracker. After a `restart` event, there will be no conversation history and no record of the restart.

**Automatic Tracking**: 

* Whenever the `/restart` default intent is triggered.


**JSON**:

```json
{
    "event": "restart"
}
```


**Rasa Open Source Class**: `rasa.core.events.Restarted`

### Reset All Slots

Resets all slots on the tracker to `null`. 

**Automatic Tracking**: Never

**JSON**:

```json
{
    "event": "reset_slots"
}
```

**Rasa Open Source Class**: `rasa.core.events.AllSlotsReset`


### Schedule a Reminder

Schedules an intent to be triggered at a certain time in the future. 

**Automatic Tracking**: Never

**JSON**:

```json
{
  "event": "reminder",
  "intent": "my_intent",
  "entities": {"entity1": "value1", "entity2": "value2"},
  "date_time": "2018-09-03T11:41:10.128172",
  "name": "my_reminder",
  "kill_on_user_msg": true,
}
```

**Parameters**:

* `intent`: Intent which the reminder will  trigger 
* `entities`: Entities to send with the intent
* `date_time`: Date at which the execution of the action should be triggered. This should either be in UTC or include a timezone.
* `name`: ID of the reminder. If there are multiple reminders with the same id only the last will be run.
* `kill_on_user_msg`: Whether a user message before the trigger time will abort the reminder

**Rasa Open Source Class**: `rasa.core.events.ReminderScheduled`


### Cancel a reminder

Cancels a scheduled reminder or reminders. 
All reminders which match the supplied parameters will be cancelled.

**Automatic Tracking**: Never

**JSON**:

```json
{
  "event": "cancel_reminder",
  "name": "my_reminder",
  "intent": "my_intent",
  "entities": [
        {"entity": "entity1", "value": "value1"},
        {"entity": "entity2", "value": "value2"},
    ],
  "date_time": "2018-09-03T11:41:10.128172",
}
```

**Parameters**:


* `intent`: Intent which the reminder will  trigger 
* `entities`: Entities to send with the intent
* `date_time`: Date at which the execution of the action should be triggered. This should either be in UTC or include a timezone.
* `name`: ID of the reminder.


**Rasa Open Source Class**: `rasa.core.events.ReminderCancelled`

### Pause a conversation

Stops the bot from responding to user messages. The conversation will remain paused and no actions will be predicted until  the conversation is explicitly [resumed](#resume-a-conversation).

**Automatic Tracking**: Never

**JSON**:

```json
{
    "event": "pause"
}
```

**Rasa Open Source Class**: `rasa.core.events.ConversationPaused`

### Resume a Conversation

Resume a previously paused conversation. Once this event is added to the tracker the bot will start predicting actions again. It will not predict actions for user messages received while the conversation was paused.

**Automatic Tracking**: Never

**JSON**:

```json
{
    "event": "resume"
}
```


**Rasa Open Source Class**: `rasa.core.events.ConversationResumed`

### Force a Followup Action

Force the next action to be the one specified, bypassing action prediction. 

**Automatic Tracking**: Never

**JSON**:

```json
{
    "event": "followup",
    "name": "my_action"
}
```

**Parameters**:

* `name`: The name of the follow up action that will be executed.


**Rasa Open Source Class**: `rasa.core.events.FollowupAction`

### User Sent a Message

The user sent a message to the bot. 

**Automatic Tracking**: 

Any message the user sends to the bot will automatically be tracked. This event is not
usually returned by a custom action, but can be used to simulate the effect of an actual user message on the conversation.

**JSON**:

```json
{
    "event": "user",
    "text": "Hey",
    "parse_data": {
        "intent": {
            "name": "greet",
            "confidence": 0.9
        },
        "entities": []
    },
    "metadata": {},
}
```

**Parameters**:

* `text`: Text of the user message
* `parse_data`: Parsed data of user message. This is ordinarily filled by NLU.
* `metadata`: Arbitrary metadata that comes with the user message

**Rasa Open Source Class**: `rasa.core.events.UserUttered`

### Bot Sent a Message

The bot sent a message to the user.
Any `responses` returned by the action server are turned into this event type. 


**Automatic Tracking**: Any responses sent to the user directly without being sent by a custom action (e.g. `utter_` actions) are also automatically tracked with a `bot` event. This event is not usually be returned explicitly by the action server; `responses` would be returned instead. Any `responses` returned by the action server are automatically tracked as `bot` events. 

**JSON**:

```json
{
    "event": "bot",
    "text": "Hey there!",
    "data": {}
}
```

**Parameters**:

* `text`: The text the bot sends to the user
* `data`: Any non-text elements of the bot response. The structure of `data` matches that of a `response` given in the [API spec](api-spec.mdx).

**Rasa Open Source Class**: `rasa.core.events.BotUttered`


### Revert a User Message

Undoes all side effects of the last user message and removes the last `user` event from the tracker. 

**Automatic Tracking**: 

**JSON**:

```json
{
    "event": "rewind"
}
```

**Rasa Open Source Class**: `rasa.core.events.UserUtteranceReverted`


### Revert an Action

Undoes all side effects of the last bot action and removes the last bot action from the tracker. 

**Automatic Tracking**: 

**JSON**:

```json
{
    "event": "undo"
}
```

**Rasa Open Source Class**: `rasa.core.events.ActionReverted`


### Log an Executed Action

Logs an action that the bot executed. Only the action itself is logged; the events that the action creates are logged separately when they are applied. 

**Automatic Tracking**: 

* Any action executed
by the action server is automatically logged as such. 

This event is not usually returned explicitly by a custom action. 

**JSON**:

```json
{
    "event": "action",
    "name": "my_action"
}
```

**Parameters**:

* `name`: Name of the action that was executed


**Rasa Open Source Class**: `rasa.core.events.ActionExecuted`


### Start a New Conversation Session

Starts a new conversation by resetting the tracker and running the default action `ActionSessionStart`. This action will by default carry over existing `SlotSet` events to a new conversation session. You can configure this behaviour in your domain file under `session_config`.

**Automatic Tracking**: 

* Whenever a user starts a conversation with the bot for the first time.
* Whenever a session expires (after `session_expiration_time` specified in the domain), and the user resumes their conversation

Restarting a conversation with [`restart`](#restart-a-conversation) event **does not** automatically cause a `session_started` event. 

**JSON**:

```json
{
    "event": "session_started"
}
```

**Rasa Open Source Class**: `rasa.core.events.SessionStarted`
