Conversations in Rasa are represented as a sequence of events.
Custom actions can influence the course of a conversation by adding 
events to the tracker. It is expected that a custom action
return a list of events, which are defined by their payload.
Rasa Open Source takes the payload of events returned by an action server
and turns them into "Rasa events" that are then applied to the conversation tracker.
