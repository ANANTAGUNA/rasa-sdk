There are two ways to run the action server, depending on whether you 
are using an environment with 
`rasa` installed or not:

If `rasa` is installed, you can run the action server using a `rasa` command:

```bash
rasa run actions
```

If `rasa` is not installed, you can run the action server directly as a python module:

```bash
python -m rasa_sdk --actions actions
```

Using the command above, `rasa_sdk` will expect to find your actions 
in a file called `actions.py`
or in a package directory called `actions`. 
You canspecify the actions module or package with the `--actions` flag.

The full list of options for running the action server with either command is:

```text [python -m rasa_sdk --help]
```
