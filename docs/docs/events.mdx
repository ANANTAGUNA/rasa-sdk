Custom actions can influence the course of a conversation by adding 
events to the tracker. 
Each custom action returns a list of events.
Rasa Open Source takes the payload of events returned by a custom action server
and turns them into "Rasa events" that are then applied to the conversation tracker.
Besides the explicitly returned events, rasa-sdk also has a Dispatcher, which
specifically sends bot responses. The dispatcher basically auto-adds events;
they don't have to be explicitly returned.





```python (docs/sources/rasa_sdk/events.py)
```
