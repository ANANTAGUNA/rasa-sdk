The `Action` class is the base class for any custom action. It has two methods
that must both to be overwritten, `name` and `run`.

In a restaurant bot, if the user says “show me a Mexican restaurant”,
your bot could execute the action `ActionCheckRestaurants`,
which might look like this:

```python
from rasa_sdk import Action
from rasa_sdk.events import SlotSet

class ActionCheckRestaurants(Action):
   def name(self) -> Text:
      return "action_check_restaurants"

   def run(self,
           dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher,
           tracker: Tracker,
           domain: Dict[Text, Any]) -> List[Dict[Text, Any]]:

      cuisine = tracker.get_slot('cuisine')
      q = "select * from restaurants where cuisine='{0}' limit 1".format(cuisine)
      result = db.query(q)

      return [SlotSet("matches", result if result is not None else [])]
```

This action queries a database to find restaurants matching
the requested cuisine, and uses the list of restaurants found 
to set the value of the `matches` slot. 

## Methods

### Action.name

The name returned by this method should be included in your bot's domain

* **Returns**:

  Name of action

* **Return type**: 

  `str`

### Action.run

``async Action.run(dispatcher, tracker, domain):``

The `run` method executes the side effects of the action. 


#### **Parameters**

  * **dispatcher** – the [dispatcher](dispatcher.mdx) which is used to
    send messages back to the user. Use
    `dispatcher.utter_message()` or any other
    `rasa_sdk.executor.CollectingDispatcher`
    method.

  * **tracker** – the state [tracker](tracker.mdx) for the current
    user. You can access slot values using
    `tracker.get_slot(slot_name)`, the most recent user message
    is `tracker.latest_message.text` and any other
    `rasa_sdk.Tracker` property.

  * **domain** – the bot's domain
