There is no requirement for the structure of a custom action itself, as long 
as it is executed when the action server receives a request to run it
by name, and returns a correctly formatted list of events. 


You can implement seperate actions however you'd like but:

- the endpoint needs to know the names of the actions somehow
- the actions must be callable by name
- it probably makes sense to use classes for this
- input/output must match api spec
